<h3>Running your Gedmatch KIT number in a Gedmatch Project:</h3>
<pre>
For these examples I've used "An Irish Gedmatch Project" but the principle is the same for any project:

1. From the menu on Gedmatch.com go to Projects under free tools

2. Choose the "radio button" box beside the project you wish to run and type or paste in your Gedmatch kit number

3. Under Sort Options, choose <strong>"Kit Number"</strong>. Most Recent Common Ancestor is the default, great for you but effectively random order for anybody else. Then press the <strong>[Submit]</strong> button.

Then on the resulting page copy and paste some pages to the project facebook page. Omit any people's email addresses - that bit is very important. Also include your Gedmatch Kit number in your post. 
Alternatively to just copy/paste of the page, you can download the CSV file with the button provided and edit it in Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice to remove e-mail addresses. 
It is also helpful to post a link to your public tree and perhaps some key surnames, places and dates.
