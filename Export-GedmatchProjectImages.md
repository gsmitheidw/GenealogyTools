# Export-GedmatchProjectImages

Exports match results of Gedmatch Project to batches of images.

## Overview
Output files contain 500 closest kits (by MRCA) which are then
sorted into ascending kit number order. Output files are also 
named in sequence in the filename.

## Usage

1. Run the gedmatch project, download the csv file using the "Download CSV" button
2. [Download this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsmitheidw/GenealogyTools/main/Export-GedmatchProjectImages.ps1) and open it in "Powershell ISE" which is already preinstalled
in windows.
3. Press the green triangle play button. It will prompt you to choose the CSV file
downloaded from Gedmatch. Once you do that, it'll create image files in the same folder
the CSV file is in. 

## Notes

Always spot check output files before posting. Gedmatch doesn't include e-mail addresses in the
CSV file but this could change.
